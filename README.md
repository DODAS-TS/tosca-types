# INDIGO TOSCA types

The repository shows a YAML description of new types added in the INDIGO project to extend TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML Version 1.0 to add high level entities.
In the examples directory there are a set of TOSCA documents using these types that will be supported by the INDIGO components.
